Press any key to say SNAP when the value of the last two cards displayed on the screen matches

  ** 1 point is gained if you SNAP correctly **
  ** 1 point is lost  if you SNAP when the value of the cards dont match **
  ** 1 point is lost if you don't SNAP and the value of cards match **
  ** Press esc key to exit the game **
